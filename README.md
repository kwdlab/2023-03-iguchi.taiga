# Overview

CLEFIA is a symmetric block cipher which processes data blocks of 128 bits using a cipher key of length of 128, 192, or 256 bits.

# Requirements

・Xilinx PYNQ-Z1 (FPGA board)
・pynq_z1_v3.0.1 (SD card image)
・Vitis HLS 2022.1
・Vivado 2022.1

# Install and Usage

・"CLEFIA" contains files I used to generate bitstreams.

・"pynq_jupyter" is a directory, downloaded from PYNQ. It contains uploaded files (e.g. ".bit", ".hwh", and ".c" files) and jupyter notebooks.
"pynq_jupyter/CLEFIA/src/" and "pynq_jupyter/CLEFIA/bitstreams" have directories that show the key length of CLEFIA("128", "192", "256").
"128", "192", and "256" under "pynq_jupyter/CLEFIA/src/" contain executable files generated by gcc with -O option.
 
・"FPGA_data.xlsx" is an excel file that contains data I collected from Vitis HLS, Vivado, and jupyter notebook.
